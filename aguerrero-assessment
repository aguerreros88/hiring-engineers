First, i have installed Vagrant 2.2.19 and Virtual Box 6.1, in mi Windows 10 computer.


I created a new folder to allocate all the files from the VM.

I have create the VM and initialize the VM, OS installed is Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS



After de creation the VM and Running i have created the trial Account in the Data Dog Web to install the  Agent: 




Crate the tags: 




After the instalation of the Agent i proceed to install my sql to connect a data base to the agent.



I have configured the automatically system startup for mysql:

I have created a user and password in mysql: 


I have prepare mysql server giving privilees to collect the metrics:

after restarting the agent, the MySQL integration showed up in the UI


I used the Agent commands to view the MySQL check:

Create a custom Agent check that submits a metric named my_metric with a random value between 0 and 1000.




Here i run the command: sudo -u dd-agent -- datadog-agent check my_metric to verify my metric:



Showing my metric in the sumary: 



By default the custom check will run at 15 second intervals. Update the my_check.yaml file so that it runs at 45 second intervals:




- Bonus Question Can you change the collection interval without modifying the Python check file you created?

- Yes! You can update the collection interval in the my_metric.yaml file that i have created.


Visualizing Data:

I have created a account in postman to validate the API Key, before the validation y have created an API Ke and Application key:



After create the app keys, i have validate the API Keys in postman:




I have installed the Python3-pip libraries on my vm and the datadog-api-cliente, after installing i had some issues and i made and upgrade of the datadog-api-client:




After the instalartion of the api clinet y have create the example.py file in the vm:


After installing the client and created the example.py file y have  run the commands: 


i have confirmed it's created in the DatadogDashboard:



fter confirmed the api is working, i have modify the script in example.py
The First widget takes the average of metric, the second widget uses the anomalies function and the third widget uses the rollup function.




after modify the script i execute the code vida terminal to exedcute the script, after i see the newly created dashboard in the datadog platform:


This is the Dashboard in the Datadog platform:


This is the response we have in the past 5 minutes: 


This is the snap:


This is the capture of the email from the comment:


What is the Anomaly graph displaying?

The anomaly function is an algorithmic, shows as a grey band in the metric line, showing th expected behavior of a series based on the past. 




Monitoring Data


I havce created a new monitor from my metric: 
1. Define the alert conditions.

2. Create the notification that alert, warning or No data State: 

 

View from DataDog platform:



The three emails: 

1. Warning


2. Alert

3. No Data

Scheduling downtime for the notification after 7PM week days.


Scheduling downtime for notification on Weekends whole day: 

Both down times:





Collecting APM Data


I have install pip 
After pip i have install ddtrace:


then  install Flask

I have created a basic app, app.py:



i have add configuration to the datadog's  agent for the APM:



After i have run the command of the configuration snippet
DD_SERVICE="TEST_DATADOG_ALCIDES" DD_ENV="apm_test" DD_LOGS_INJECTION=true ddtrace-run python app.py



What is the difference between a Service and a Resource?
